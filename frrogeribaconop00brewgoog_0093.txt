“ and man3 because knowing not what is prior, they
“ must remain ignorant of what is posterior.—Wherefore,
“ through ignorance of this science, the ordinary natural
“ philosophy cannot be mastered‚ nor speculative and
“ consequently not practical medicine ; not only
‘⁴ because natural philosophy and speculative medicine
“ are required for the practice of medicine, but
“ because all simple medicines of inanimato things are
‘⁴ derived from this science. For neither the names
“ nor the significations of medicines can be learned,
“ except from this science3 that is, from speculative
“ alchemy, which speculates upon all inanimate things,
“ and the generation of all things from their elementa.

“ There is also an operative or practical alchemy
‘⁴ which teaches man how to make noble metals
“ and colours‚ and many other things, better and
“ more copiously by art than by nature. And this
“ science is more important than all that have pre-
“ ceded, because it is productive of more advantages. It
“ not only provides money for a state, but teaches the
“ means of prolonging life, so far as nature will allow
“ it to be prolonged3 for we die sooner than we ought
“ for want of a proper regimen in youth, and owing
“ to diseased constitutions derived from our fathers.
“ But this twofold science of alchemy is scarcely
“ understood by any; for although many through-
“ out the world labour to make metals and colourS,
“ few know how to make colours truly and usefully3
‘⁴ scarcely any know how to make metals, and still
“ fewer to produce those things which avail for the
“ prolongation os life. There are very few who can
“ distil properly, or sublime, or calcine, or resolve,
“ or perform other operations of this kind.”

He ought, then, in conclusion, and in conformity with
his design, to have treated of experimental philosophy
and of particular, the scionccs confirming by special ¹
application thc general and moro abstract principles
