the Devil3 of the circle they knew nothing more than
its property of keeping away evil spirits, and they
dreaded lest religion itself should be wounded by the
anglae of a triangle¹ The barbarousness of his age gave
Bacon so much anxiety and produced him so many
enemieS, that he almost regretted he had ever entered
on such labours or troubled himself with experiments.
His books were scarcely permitted a place in the
libraries of his order. So inveterate were the monks
against him, that when they mocked at his discover-ies
as the result of magio, they accused him of holding
and propagating opinions hostile to the purity of the
Christian saith. Some say he was actually cast into
prison upon an accusation of certain stupid friars ; and
that by Hieronymus de Esculo‚ the general of his order?

assertion made in the text, and refers

Aster speaking of the election of
Hieronymus de Asculo to the ge-
neralship of the order in 12⁷4, he
thus proceeds: ‘⁴ Anno Domini

⁷79, ed. Venet. 1⁵86. Thus then,
supposing the statement of Anto-
ninus to be trusworthy, Bacon vas
not committed to prison by the

Pope, nor by Nicholss IV„ but by
