tire books and copious extracts from the Opus Majus
may be found in every great library. Not so the
Opus Minus. It was comparatively unknown.

The evidence, already sufficiently strong to sub-
stantia-te the authenticity of this fingment, may be
closed by two observatione: first, that the same young
man, juvenis J ohaames) is mentioned as having been
sent with the work to explain its difficulties and ex-
hibit certain experiments, as in the Opus Majus⁹ and
the Opus Tertium3 and, secondly, that, like these two
works, and unlike any other of Bacon’s werke, it was
addressed to the pope.a These are the reasons which
have induced me to ascribe this fragment without
hesitation to Roger Bacon, and affix to it the title
of the Opus Minus. The necessity for entering thus
minutely upon the identification of the work, besides
the desire of removing long-established errors, will
more fully appear in the sequeL⁴

The same year which produced the Opus Minus
gave birth to the Opus Tertium. Much that might
have been said of the matter and objects of this
treatise has been anticipated already. It has been
frequently cited by J ebb in his preface to the
Opus Majus, and from it he derived the most striking
incidents of Bacon's history. Four original MSS. of
this work at least are known to exist3 but none of
an early date3 one at Douai has been described
in detail by the veteran philosopher Victor (louein,
