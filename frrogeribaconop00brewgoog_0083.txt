logie we have by nature, its formal terms we obtain by
learning. This is obvious to common 881188, for every
man assigns the causes and reasons of his words and
80110118, and of other things with which he is familiar.
But this cannot be done except by an argument. All

, 111811 reply to falsehoods by denying them, and to

fallacies by saying‚ that it does not follow for this
reason or that. So, though laymen do not understand
the logical terms which clerics 1188, they havel their
own ways of meeting a fallacious argument. And
therefore it is not the 80181108 of logio, but the terms
only that are wanting to the laity. Then, after
stating that the discovery of 10810 presupposed the
existence of a 10810 and mode of investigation inde-
pendent of 10810, he observes. “A knowledge of rea-

“ for investigating all other sciences‚ and this 178 know
“ by experience ; for though we have been taught the
“ science of reasoning by Aristotle’s 10810, yet when
“ we handle the difficulties of other 801811088, 178 pay
“ no regard to the art of Aristode, for we know
“ not whether the proposed inquiry be a problem in
“ genus or species, or something else. Nor do we
“ know how we are to apply Aristotle to those
“ problems‚ nor could we explain how, and yet we
“ know that we argue correctly.’'

In 1118 Opus Majus ¹ he developes more fully his
sentiments on this subject. Remarking on the vast
amount of errors introduced by the corrupt versions
of Aristotle‚ and the loss of his most valuable writings,
he observes: “ Of his logie we have 1101 the best
“ book3 and the next 10 11 111 excellence, the second,
“ has been badly translated, and cannot be under-
