fier? The second root of the difficulty is that we ought
“ to have excellent mathematicians, who should not
“ only know what exists, original or translated, in
“ connection with the sciences, but be able to make
“ additions to them, which is easy for good mathema-
“ ticians to do, For there are only two perfect mathe-
“ maticians‚ Master John of London, and Master Peter
“ de Maharn-Ouria‚ a Picard. There are two other
“ good ones, Master Campanus de Novaria, and Master
“ N ieholas‚ the teacher of Aumary de Montfort.1 For
(ὅ without mathematice nothing worth knowing in phi-
“ Iosophy can be attained. And therefore it is indis-
“ pensable that good mathematicians be had, who are
“ very scaros. Nor can any one obtain their service8‚
“ especially the best of them, except it be the pope or
“ some great prince. For he would hardly oondescend
“ to live with any one who wished to be the lord of
“ his own studies, and prosecute philosophica] investi-
“ gations at his pleasure.

“ And besides these expenseS, other great expenses
“ would have to be incurred. Without mathematical
“ instruments no science can be mastered3 and these
“ instrumente are not to be found among the Latius,
“ and could not be made for two or three hundred
“ pounds, And besideS, better tables are indispensably
“ requisite‚ for although the certifying of the tables is
“ done by instrumente, yet this cannot he accomplished
“ unless there be an immense number of instruments ;
