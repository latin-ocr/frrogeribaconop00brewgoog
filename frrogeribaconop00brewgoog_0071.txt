side, from the Hebrew and the Arabio on the other.
It kept sin-iot possession of the key which could alone
unloek the seerets stored in the mysterious books of
Aristotle. In that mine what treasures of wisdom still
remained unexplored‚ what sphynx-like hints to the
toiler in the laboratory, what new suggestions of gene-
ration and transmutation, of the occult qualities of sub-
ammes, withheld from all but the initiated, and only
half communicated to vulgar capacities in the imper-
fect versions of Michael the Seot, of Flemyng‚ or of
Herman. Language itself would be too feeble to de-
scribe how the world 'was athirst for the discoveries
of the great philosopher. Suddenly introduced like the
Arabian youth into a magio garden of golden apples ·
and waxen fruits, it was puzzled and perplexed with
its new-found abundanoe, yet oraved and inquii-ed for
more. ·

But how obtain its desires? Two ways were open,
one easy, but far about3 the other direct, but difficult.
The former process was a strange one. It shows the
desperate efforts to get at the treasures over which a

ἕ yielding up none of its jewels except to those wh0, like

itself, had dealings with a wicked and subtle spirit.¹
The pale of exclusiveness was strengthened in propor-
tion to its utter ineffieieney3 intercourse with a J ew or
a Mahommedan was heresy overt. A bishop reading
Aristotle, through the medium of an Arabio translation,
with a J ew or an Arabian toacher, Heaven forefend!
The sight opened interminable vistas of godless pravity.
Yet the anathemes of pope, the decretals of Gratian,
popular murmure, were all unavailing. Aristotle must
be read3 not solely for his ethios and his logi03 but

the reputation of vizards.
