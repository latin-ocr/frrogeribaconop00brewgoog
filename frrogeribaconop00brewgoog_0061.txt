The third treatise in the volume, Compendium
Studii Philosophiae, is taken from a unique MS. in the
British Museum, Tiberius C.V., already described.¹
A copy, made by Williamson and casaubon, is in
the volume of Gale’s transcripte, containing the Opus
Tertium and Opus Majus, now in Trinity College,
Cambridge² No other MS. is now known to exist.
No trace of it is to be found in the long and intricate
catalogue of Bacon’s writings compiled by Bale, by
PittS, by Tanner, or the able editors of the Biographia
Britannica. After adopting and rejecting various titles
for the work, the transcriber eventually selected the
one it now bears in this volume, and in this he has
been followed by Gale. The first sentence of the work
probably suggested the name. Bacon states his inten-
tion of treating the subject of “ philosophy (sapientia),
“ for the present, summat-ily and in a compendium, by
“ way of introduction, until some better opportunity
‘⁴ should arise for entering on each subject in particular,
“ in its due course.” ⁸ No sufficient reason existe for
the supposition of J ebb, that this work is no more
than a second edition of the Opus Minus. ⁴ It bears
no stronger resemblance to the Opus Minus than
it does to the Opus Tertium, so far as a judg-
ment can be formed from the ftagment which has
come down to us, and the description given of it
by Bacon himself, In chap. iii.⁶ Bacon says, “ At
“ the command of Clement, the predecessor· of this
“ pope (istius papae),⁰ I collected in a special treatise
