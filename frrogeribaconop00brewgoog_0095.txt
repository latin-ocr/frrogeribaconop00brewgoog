task, is evident from the whole course of his life and
writings Numerous proofs are at· hand of his great
regard for experimental philosophy. He· considered it
as the only security against vague theories, the chief
remedy for the errors in speculation and practice pre·
valent in his age. If the world loves to contemplate
the great lord chancellor of J ames Ι. retiring from the
court or the parliament to his museum 111 Grays Inn
or at Gorhambusy, laying aside his chancellor's robe to
watch the furnace or count the drops from the alembie‚
the example of the solitary friar, with more scanty
means and fewer associatos justifying the value of
experiments, in a. darker and less favourahle age, is
not 1633 interesting. So far as the prize is to be
given to mere invention, Roger Bacon has superior
claims to Lord Bacon. But as the discoverer of a.
new method‚ which has changed the whole face of
seience‚—(for he must he called a discoverer who vin-
dicates a truth long forgotten‚ or presente it in such
a light that all must see and acknowledge its im-
portance), -in this respect Lord Bacon will always
bear the palm alone. Roger Bacon did not live in
an age when 1116 value of Aristotle as the philosopher
of nature could be appreciated at its true worth. He
reprobated the mistranslations of Aristotle, but not
Aristotle himself3 he thought there were treasures
still to be discovered in 1116 books of his Physics and
Natural History, and that better translations and
more accurate texts would justify his admiration for
the great Greek teacher. He still adopted the older
distinctions of philosophy into pure and mechanieal,
and he ranked under the latter division many of those
processes to which modern estimation has since given
a higher name. Though in his practice a. keen and
sagacious experimentalist, in his exposition of scienoe
he adopted the deductive in opposition to the induc-
tive method.
