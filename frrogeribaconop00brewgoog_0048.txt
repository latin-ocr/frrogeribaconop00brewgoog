PRErAOE. XXXV

schoolman, whose writings by no means justified the
incense he received, Bacon thus proceeds: “ 11 is 1101
“ without reason 11101 Ι have said these things of this
“ authen 1101 merely because 11 serves my purpose, 11111
“ 11 is melancholy 1ο think 11101 1110 study of philosophy
“ should have been more perverbed by him 111011 by
“ any 011101· writer 11101 ever lived among the Latine.
“ For though others had their failings‚ they did 1101
“ presume upon 111011· authorit53 whereas this man
‘¹‘ writes his book in a dogmatical form (per ‘modum
‘¹ authenticum), and so is quoted and alleged by 1110
“ whole herd of madmen 01 Paris, as if he were an
“ Aristotle, or an Avicenna, or an Averroes‚ or 1110
“ like. He has occasioned great (10111111οη1, 1101 only 10
“ science, 11111 1ο 111001οῃ, as Ι have shown in my Opus
“ Minus,¹ where Ι speak De Septem Peccatie studii

Now, on comparing 1110 account. here given with 1110 ffi·
fragment published 01 p. 313 of this volume, no (1011111

can remain of 11101 fragment consizituting a portion of
1110 genuine Opus Minus. The same conclusion is forced
upon us by other remarks; as 01 p. 33, where 1110
writer says: “ without Greek and Hebrew 1110 Ι1011113
“ can know nothing magnificem, or worth knowing‚ as
“ I have shown clearly in 1110 third part· of 1110 Opus
“ Majus, and in 1110 Opus Minus, where I speak of
“ 1110 study of bheology3 viz„ in 1110 Third, Fisth, and
“ Sixth Error (peccatwn).” Again, 01 p. 41, he
states 11101 110 11οᾶ spoken of speculative alchemy
