How he exizrimbed himself I cannot eay; certain it

is that he complains to Pope Clement IV. that he was ,

deprived of the ordinary aide of sbudy, and his books

But I put no faith in those who asseria that the
pope sent for Bacon, and ester examining him on the
charges broughb againeb him, committed him to prison.
This is not at all probable‚ since the pope held Bacon
and his studies in great admiration, aesisbed him with
money, and advanced the young man whom he sent,

prison by Raymund‚ the general of his order-,⁹ is
testified in a note appended to an ancient MS„
formerly in the library of the Earl of Dorset: “ Here
