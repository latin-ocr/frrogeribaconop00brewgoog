“ of late been circulated among the. Latins in a, de-
“ fective and squalid version. Nor is it surprising if
‘⁸ 1 say that these books of logie are the best. There
“ are four kinds of true argument3 two move the
‘⁸ speculative intellect, or the reason, sc. dialectics, by
“ a feeble and initiative habit, which is opinion, that
“ we may be disposed to science, which is a complete
“ and final habit, wherein the mind rests in the
“ contemplation of the truth. And this habit is not
“ acquired by demonstration.¹ But as the will or prac—
“ tical intellect is more noble than the speculative,
“ and virtue with felicity infinitely excels bare sci-
“ ence, and is incomparably more needful to us, it is
“ necessary that we should be furnished with argu-
“ ments to raise and exercise the practical inteHect,
“ especially as we are feebler in this respect than we
“ are in speculation„ Willingly do we teste of the
‘⁸ tree of good and evil; slow are we to teste the
‘⁸ trec of life, to embrace the dignity of virtue with a
‘⁸ view to future happiness. lt is necessary, therefore,
“ that the practical intellect should have its due aids
“ and be excited by arguments proper to itself, as
‘⁶ much as the speculative by its pcculiar aids3 and
“ it is fitting, therefore, that there should be a
“ logic for morale and theology.² For as speculative
“ sciences have speculative arguments of opinion and
“ pure science‚ so the practical scienceS, as theology and
“ ethice, embrace those arguments by which mankind
“ are excited to practice—And these arguments in mat-
“ ters of our well-being are the strongest, but powerless
“ in pure speculation3 as demonstration is most effica-
“ cious in bare speculation, but impotcnt in practice,
“ and in things which pertain to salvation. Logic
