LIFE OF ROGER BACON.

(From Woon’s Amomnms Um. Oxou.)

Oztn'rnm a great number of disputes which occurred
this year [A.D. 1292] between the University and

the town, I shall proceed to speak of a philosopher
the most celebrated that England had hitherto pro-

duced 3 I refer to Roger Baeon, a Franciscan friar, of

the University of Oxford.

He was born of a good

quote from his Opus Tertium, Rosa
concludes: “ Haec nobilis doctor

Apostoli? Tanner, in his Biblio-
theca, states that Bacon’s name,
before he took the ποτε as a Francis-
can‚ was David Dee de Radik, and
he quotes in support of this sti-ange
auertion a MS. of Br. Toryne,

“ Dc Reform. Vulg. Ca1.,’· now in
Corpus ChrIsti college, Oxford.
There is no trace of this tradition
in Baeon’s vorke, or in any o'f the
notices preserved of him in the
Chroniclee or Franciscan histories.
It was not customary, so far as Ι
can ascertain,for those who entered
the Franciscan order to change their
names. Tanner refers also to Atkyn’a
History of Gloucester for a tradition
that Baeon was born at Fodgmore
Bottom, in the parish of Bisley‚ in
the county of Gloucester, and
educated at the chapel of St. Mam,
now Bury Mill, in the parish of
Hampton, where a chamber is
still shown, called Bucon’s Study]
