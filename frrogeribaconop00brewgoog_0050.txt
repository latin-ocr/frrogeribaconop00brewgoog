From these remarks it may be fairly inferred that
the fingment‚ now published‚ is a genuine portion of the
Opus Minus 3 that aster a brief survey of the Opus
Majus, similar to that which is found in the Opus Ter-
tium, Bacon concluded the work with observations on
the state of Latin literature, and its prevalent defecta,
agreeing precisely with that portion of the book pre-
served in the Digby MS. How much has been lost can—
not easily be ascertained. In the Opus Tertium, when
speaking highly in praise of Peter de Maharn-Curia, he
remarks: “ No one can obtain the services of first-rate
“ mathematicians except my Lord the Pope, or some
“ other great prince ; especially the services of him who
“ is worth more than any of them3 of whom Ι have
“ written fully in my Opus Minus, and shall write
“ more in its proper place.” And again speaking in
the same work¹ of Magio: “ This subject‚” he says,
“ is the most difficult of any in philosophy; but
“ in my Opus Minus, where Ι speak of the heavenly
“ bodies (coelestia) and their influence8‚ I have ex-
“ pounded these things at greater length3 in that
“ place, where I have touched upon the great secrets
‘⁸ of nature, which are not to be indiscriminately di-
“ vulged to all men.”

No trace of Peter de Maharn-Curia is to be found in
the present mutilated copy of the Opus Minus, and
very little notice of magio. The facsimile (B) may
perhaps lead to the identification of the missing
portion of the work ; but after a careful examination of
such MSS. of Roger Bacon as are accessible in England,
especially in the Bodleian Library‚ Ι have not been able
to discover any other copy of the Opus Minus.⁵² En-
