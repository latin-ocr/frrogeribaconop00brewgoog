in the Sixth Error; a statement which corresponds
with p. 359 of the fragment; that in discussing
this subject¹ he had followed the principles of Avi-
cenna, in his work Dc A‘nim seo‘emdum AE'm‘9ma ,-
that he had examined the Vulgate, and the labours
of St. Jerome in the translation of the Scriptures‚²
and had given instance's of corruptions and mistakes
arising from ignoranoe of the original languages‚⁸ in
the Sixth Error. All these notices agree minutely
with the fragment now printed from the Digby MS.

The references, made in the fragment itself to the
Opus Majm, lead to the same conclusion. It speaks
of the first, fourth, fifth, and of the seventh part ⁴ of
that work De I ‘ra ;6 of the division entitled Scientia
Efferimentalis, and the treatise on Optics (Perspec-
tiva) ; of the remarks made upon Grammar in the first
pari-„⁶ and 1119 praise of Mathematics in 1119 fourth.⁷
The writer then addet “ After reading what is written
“ in this work, which Ι now send, Ι thought fit to
“ conclude with some observatione on the errors in
“ the studies of the Latine, which 919 great, and of
“ their remedies‚ which are still greater; and to
“ notify to your Excellence by what persons and by
‘⁶ what means all these things might be accomph'shed3
“ and this I do in the place specifled‚ because this is
“ the final and principal use of my book. And lest my
“ former work should be lost, through any dangers
“ on the road, I have thought it right to keep the
“ same end in view here, against all contingencies,
“ even as I have in this compendium abridged the
“ substance of the whole of that longer treatise.”
