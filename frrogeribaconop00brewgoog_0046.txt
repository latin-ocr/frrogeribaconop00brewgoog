“ may sec who inspecta the Cotton MS. (Opus Minus
‘⁴ cap. 1. MS. Cot. Tib. O. v. f. 121.)

“ In the MS. of the King’s Library a treatise is to bo
“ found entitled Liber Naturalium Royeri Βαοοη, called
‘¹ by Leland and others Communia N atum-alie Philo-

‘⁶ ‘ have treated of the different parts of Mathematics3
“ ‘ now in the third place comes Natural Philosophy,
‘⁸ ‘ to which Metaphysics and Morals shall be joined in
“ ‘ the fourth? This is tho order which Bacon says he
“ should observo in his Opus Minus, Se, if I mistake
“ not, this work will contain the following books 2—-

“ 1. De Swmma Gramwnaticali.

“ 2. De Omwtruotiom Panium.

“ 3. De Loyioa. “ ·
“ 4. De Laudibus Artis Mathematicae.

“ 5. Ommunia Naturabie Philosophiae.
“ 6. De Metaphysica.

‘⁴ 7. De I ntellectu et forsan Ι ntelliqibi li.¹
‘⁴ 8. De U niverealibue.'’
