“ ‘ I might, explain the scope 01· my chief and principal
“ ‘ treatise. I wished, besides, that my labours should
“ ‘ be known to your Clemency, and that you should
“ ‘ have a pattern whereby to refresh your memory,
“ ‘ on those points, which you are bo demand of
“ ‘learned men. For as the size of the volume was
“ ‘ great, and had to be divided into four, and the
“ ‘ occupatione of the holy see are pressing and multifa-
“ ‘ ricus, Ι thought you should here see, in an abridg-
‘⁶ ‘ ment, what is treated at greater length in the Opus
“ ,‘ Majus. For many difficult questions are discussed
“ ‘ in that book, which are hard of comprehension;
“ ‘ therefore, by way of introduction, I determined to
“ ‘ compose a. second treatise and 80 diminish the diffi-
“ ‘ culty 01· the first. The same motives which produced
“ ‘ the second (Opus M‘e'mus), led me to compose the
“ ‘ third (Opus Panium) for the clem-er understanding
“ ‘ and perfectiori of the two former.' However, after
