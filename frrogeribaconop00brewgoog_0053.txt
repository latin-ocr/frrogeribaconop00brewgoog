MS. eof thee 2. Α second MS. preserved in the Lambeth Library‚
1⁸¹⁰ ambeth N o 202, here designated by the letter L, is a folio on
L11.brary paper of the fourteenth century, very closely written,
and far from easy to read. This MS. has hitherto eluded
the search of Bacon's bibliographers, in consequence of
the title prefixed to it by some modern hand, De laude
Sacrae Scripturoe ,· and under this designation it is
quoted by Tanner as an independent work. It is im-
perfect, extending only to the close of the 45th chapter ;
the rest has been lost. The catch-words of chapter xlvi.
are found at the bottom of the page.¹ It contains also
a portion of the Opus Majus in a somewhat different
hand.

For the unrestrained use of this MS. I am greatly
indebted to the liberality of his Grace the present

Archbishop of Canterbury.
