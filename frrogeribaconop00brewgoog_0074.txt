So elsewhere in the Opus Tertium, speaking of
oue of the schoolmen in great estimation at the
time, but whose name he forbears to mention, Bacon
observes :¹ “ The above -named inoompetent author
“ has no more real acquaintance with philosophy
“ than the rest of the vulgar. There are not five
“ men in Latin Chr-istendom who are acquainted
“ with the Hebrew, Greek, and Arabio grammar. I
⁹ “ know them well, for I have made diligent in-
“ quiry on both sides of the sea, and laboured
‘⁴ much in those things. There are many persons
“ among the Latius who can speak Greek, Arabio,
“ and HebreW, very few who understand the gram-
“ mar of these language5‚ or know how to teach them,
“ for I have put many to the test. For as the
‘⁴ laity speak languages which they have learnt,
“ yet know nothing of the grammar, so is it with
“ these men. I have seen many laymen who spoke
“ Latin admirably well, yet knew nothing of the
“ rules of grammar-3 and so is it now with almost
“ all the Jews, and even the native Greeks, and
“ not merely with the Latins who understand
“ Greek and Hebrew. For as the Jews and the
“ Greeks have lost the wisdom of ‚God, and with it
“ the wisdom of philosophy, there are very few among
“ them who can teach the grammar correctly, and
“ give the rules and the reasons of it, as we Latius
“ understand our‘ grammar by the help of Priscian.
“ And even when they do understand the lan-
“ gunges, they know nothing of . the sciences. And
‘¹ therefore they cannot translate or do anything use-
“ ful, or intermeddlc in studies to any good purpose,
“ although they may be apt and indispensable as·
