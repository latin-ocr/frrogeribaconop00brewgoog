diagramS‚ to treet abstruse and scientific questione, in
an age unaccustomed to scientifio demonstration. To
gain the ear of the pope, whom he was anxious to
enlist in the cause of philosophy, he had to descend
to a sssyle and manner clear and popular enough to
suit the ordinary capacity of one, whose sympathies
and good wishes constituted his only claim to ‘be an
arbiter of scienoe. No help was ab hand; no friends
to advise3 neither tables nor instrument-⁴1 to verify or
abridge his calculatione. The translations from seien-
tific works of the Greek and Arabian were utterly
worthless3 MSS. of the originale not to be procured.
The copies of Bacon’s own work& as they exist ab the
present day, afford unmistakeable evidence of ‘ohe ob·
tueenees of his transcribere, ignorant of every language
but the Latin, uneocusbomed to scientifie terme, indif-
ferent to criticism.¹ FriendleSS, unaided by his family,
thwarted by his superiora, if not diseounbenanoed
by the very pope who had enjoined the taek, he
had nothing but the force of his own genius and hia
unoonquerable love of the truth wherewith to surmount
these overwhelming difficulties In what estimation
modern philosophy may hold his researehee it is not
easy to decide3 but in his vast and unwearied labours
in the cause of scienoe,—that never-failing charae·
teristie of true scientifica insigms-Roga Baeon may
fairly take rank with the greatest pioneers of modern

discovery.
