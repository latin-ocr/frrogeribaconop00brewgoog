elsewhere called the Opus Maj ue,1 commencing with
these words: Sapientiae perfecta consideratio. The
differenoe in the copies of works which bear the same
name is enormou83 end this is specially the case

De rerum Genmatmibm? of which I have seen two
copies, varying much. Whereas in the Cotton MS„
at the end of the Gowmnwnia N amo-alium? the subject
is treated with much greater perspicuity than in either
of the Digby MSS. marked A. 19 and num. 70.

3. Some books which bear his name are attributed
to others; ae a treatise with the title De fluxu et
re ων, Mam Rvetoenmci, ⁴ is ascribed to Walter
Burley3 another, De U tibitatc Astro‘nomioe, is attri-
buted to Wimam Botoner on Bale'e authority.⁶ The
Bogerina Major et Minor is given to another author.

4. Some books thought to be his are not by him,
ae “ A treatise on the Psalter‚” beginning Beatus vir ;
“ The Life of St. Edmund‚ archbishop of Canterbury.''
A treatise on the Magnet ⁶ is attributed to him by Allen,
its former poesessor‚ but by the generality of critice to
Pietro Pelegrino 3 and so ie another work, syncatoyore-
mata, fratris Robcrti Bacon, beginning, Panem ora-
tionis quaedwm eunt declinabiles.
