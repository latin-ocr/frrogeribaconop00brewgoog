mining. Among the Digby MSS. of the Bodleian, the
following works upon logie are found:

Digby, No. 20 4, fol. vellum, saec. xiii.

i. Summula Dialectiees Rogeri Bacon. f. 48-75.
Ine. I ‘ntroductio est brevis et apta demmtratio
‘im aliquam artem vel scientiam—
“ Expliciunt summulae Mag. Rogeri Bacon.'’

ii. syncategorematiea fratris Roberti¹ [Baeon].

Ine„ Panium orationis quoedam sunt declina-
biles, quaedam indeclinabiles—-

Digby, No. 67, a fragment.

Iowipit summa May. Royeri Bacmz cle soph-is-
matibus et distinctionibus. Potest quoeri de
Loyicalibus accidentibus2—

It does not, however, appear that he devoted the compa aira-
same degree of labour and thought to logie as he did tot d· ffere¹ [ω
other parts of philosophy. In his Compendium Theologiae,· ogie.
as already stated, he professed his intention to enter on
the consideration of those verbal disputes which divided
the N ominalists and the Realists of his days3 and in
the same work he has devoted several pageS‚ as the
nature of his subject demanded, to the consideration of
the nature of words. But in none of these instances
has he entered on the subject of logie with the same
amount of care and ‚interest as on grammar, mathe-
maticS, or experimenta-l sciense. The reasons of this
comparative indifference to the claime of Aristotelian
logie are not difficult to divine. In the Opus Ter-⁸
tium³ he states that the two great portale to science
are language and mathematics. But as for logie, he
says, that is of less consequence (non est vis tanta) ε
