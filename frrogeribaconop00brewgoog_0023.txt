X PREFACE.

to entitle Compendium Philosophiae, for reasons to be
presently stated, no notice is to be found, with the
exception of two meagre and vague references made to
it by J ebb in the volume already referred t0. It
appears from his statement, which will be considered
hereafter, that J ebb regarded the Compendium Philoso-
phiae as forming a second and enlarged edition of the
Opus MinuS.¹

To remove some of the misconceptions existing in
reference to these treatises‚ and the many errors
occasioned by the variety of their titles, I propose
to give a brief account of their literary history.
The publication of the present volume supplies mate-
rials hitherto unknown to the biographers of Roger
Bacon, and more obvious means for correcting pre-

vious mistakeS.
